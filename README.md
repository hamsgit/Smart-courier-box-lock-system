# Smart-door-lock-system

Overview
This project aims to develop a smart lock system that enhances security using an embedded microcontroller and PIN-based authentication. Unlike traditional key-based locks, this system ensures only authorized users can unlock the door. It also features real-time monitoring, motion detection, and alerts for unauthorized access attempts.

Problem Statement
Traditional key-based locks pose several security risks, including:
  Key loss, theft, or duplication, leading to unauthorized access.
  Physical locks being vulnerable to picking or forced entry.
  Lack of remote access, making it difficult to monitor or manage security.
  No alert system, preventing detection of unauthorized access attempts.
  
Solution
The Password-Based Smart Lock System enhances security by integrating:
  PIN-Based Authentication: Unlocks the door only for authorized users.
  Intruder Detection: Monitors motion near the door and detects suspicious activity.
  Auto-Lock Mechanism: Temporarily locks the system after three incorrect attempts.
  Real-Time Alerts: Sends notifications for failed login attempts or suspicious behavior.
  Remote Monitoring: A web-based control panel allows users to monitor and manage access remotely.

In western countries we can see there will be parcel collection boxes placed on out side, where parcels from delivery agents or othe posts will be put in and the owner will collect them later. However this has a risk of goods being stolen by anyone. So this lock system can also be a product to give security for such collection boxes. Our system is designed to be accessed by two type of users, master or guest, and there will be a feature to get alert when the box is broken or opened without entering password.
The lock will be locked after a certain time interval and the owner can observe the lock status and updates of whenever the lock is opened, and alert notifications through a website.
